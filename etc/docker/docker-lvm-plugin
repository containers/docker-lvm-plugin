# Update volume group (vg) name in this file. A volume group name is needed 
# to create logical volumes using docker lvm plugin. You can choose an existing
# volume group name by listing volume groups on your system using `vgs` command 
# OR create a new volume group using `vgcreate` command. 
# e.g. vgcreate volume_group_one /dev/hda where /dev/hda is your partition or
# whole disk on which physical volumes were created.
